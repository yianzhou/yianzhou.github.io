# The Tortured Poets Department

## Fortnight

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]

I was **supposed to be** sent away

But they forgot to come and get me

I was a **functioning alcoholic** 功能性酗酒者

'Til nobody noticed my new **aesthetic** 美学的；美感的；

**All of this to say** I hope you're okay

But you're the reason

And no one here's to blame 这不能怪任何人

But what about your quiet **treason** 背叛；不忠

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]

And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather

Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]

All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the **miracle** **move-on** drug, the effects were temporary 神奇的忘情水

And I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my **sweater** 毛衣；针织衫

Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors

My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

[Outro: Post Malone, Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]

Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

'Nother fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida, buy the car you want

But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me

[Verse 1]
You left your typewriter at my apartment **straight from** the tortured poets department

:::tip

Go straight from here to the traffic light.

:::

I think some things I never say like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"

But you're in self-**sabotage** mode

:::tip

sabotage 破坏 self-sabotage 自暴自弃

:::

Throwing **spikes** down on the road

But I've seen this **episode** and still loved the show

Who else decodes you?

[Chorus]

And who's gonna hold you like me?

And who's gonna know you, if not me?

I laughed in your face and said "You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith. This ain't the **Chelsea** 切尔西 Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"

And who's gonna hold you like me?

[Verse 2]

You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate

We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist

I **scratch** your head, you fall asleep like a tattooed **golden retriever**

But you awaken with **dread** 恐惧

**Pounding nails** in your head

But I've read this one where you come undone

I chose this **cyclone** 热带风暴 with you

[Bridge]

Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna **screw** this **up** with me

But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave

And I had said that to Jack about you, so **I felt seen**

Everyone we know understands why it's **meant to be** 命中注定的

'Cause we're crazy

So tell me, who else is gonna know me?

At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger

And put it on the one people put **wedding rings** on

And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding

## Down Bad

[Verse 1]

Did you really **beam** me up

In a cloud of sparkling dust

:::tip

sparkle 闪耀；闪烁

sprinkle 洒；小雨

:::

Just to do experiments on?

Tell me I was the chosen one

Showed me that this world is bigger than us

Then sent me back where I came from

[Pre-Chorus]

For a moment, I knew **cosmic** love

[Chorus]

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym

Everything comes out teenage **petulance** 易怒；性急

"What if I can't have him"

"I might just die, it would make no difference"

Down bad, wakin' up in blood

Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up

What if I can't have us

I might just not get up, I might stay

[Verse 2]

Did you take all my old clothes

Just to leave me here, naked and alone

In a field in my same old town

That somehow seems so **hollow** now?

They'll say I'm **nuts** if I talk about the existence of you

[Bridge]

I loved your **hostile** **takeovers**

**Encounters** closer and closer

All your **indecent** exposures

How dare you say that it's—

I'll build you a **fort** on some planet

Where they can all understand it

How dare you think it's romantic

Leaving me safe and **stranded**

## So Long, London

[Verse 1]

I saw in my mind **fairy lights** through the **mist**

:::tip

fairy 小仙女

:::

I kept calm and carried the weight of the **rift**

Pulled him in tighter each time he was **drift**in' away

My **spine** split from carrying us up the hill

**Wet through** my clothes, **weary** bones caught the **chill**

I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna **drill** the safe

[Chorus]

Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had, did you think I had, in me?"

Oh, the **tragedy**

So long, London

You'll find someone

[Verse 2]

I didn't **opt in** to be your odd man out

I founded the club she's heard great things about

I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the **Heath**

I stoppеd CPR after all, it's no use

The spirit was gonе, we would never come to

And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

[Chorus]

For so long, London

**Stitches** undone

Two graves, one gun

I'll find someone

[Bridge]

And you say I abandoned the ship

But I was going down with it

My **white-knuckle** dying **grip**

:::tip

knuckle 指关节

:::

Holding tight to your quiet **resentment**

And my friends said it isn't right to be scared

Every day of a love affair

Every breath feels like **rarest** air

When you're not sure if he wants to be there

[Chorus]

Oh, the tragedy

Just how low did you

Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-**implode**?

'Fore I'd have to go be free?

[Verse 3]

You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?

I died on the **altar** waitin' for the proof

You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days

And I'm just getting color back into my face

I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for

## But Daddy I Love Him

I forget how the West was won

I forget if this was ever fun

I just learned these people only raise you to cage you

Sarahs and Hannahs in their **Sunday best**

**Clutching** their pearls, sighing "What a mess"

I just learned these people try and save you cause they hate you

Too high a horse

For a simple girl to rise above it

They slammed the door on my whole world

The one thing I wanted

Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned

Screaming "But Daddy I love him!"

I'm having his baby

No, I'm not, but you should see your faces

I'm telling him to **floor** it through the **fences**

No, I'm not coming to my senses

I know he's crazy but he's the one I want

**Dutiful** daughter, all my plans were laid

**Tendrils** tucked into a **woven braid**

Growing up **precocious** sometimes means not growing up at all

He was chaos, he was **revelry**

**Bedroom eyes** like a **remedy**

Soon enough the elders had **convened down** at the city hall

"Stay away from her"

The **saboteurs** protested too much

Lord knows the words we never heard

Just **screeching tires** and true love

I'll tell you something right now

I'd rather burn my whole life down

Than listen to one more second of all this **griping** and **moaning**

I'll tell you something about my good name

It's mine alone to **disgrace**

I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

God save the most **judgmental** **creeps**

Who say they want what's best for me

**Sanctimoniously** performing **soliloquies** I'll never see

Thinking it can change the beat of my heart when he touches me

And counteract the chemistry and undo the destiny

You ain't gotta pray for me

Me and my wild boy

And all this wild joy

If all you want is gray for me

Then it's just white noise

And it's just my choice

There's a lot of people in town that I

**Bestow** upon my fakest smiles

**Scandal** does funny things to pride

But brings lovers closer

We came back when the heat died down

Went to my parents and they came around

All the wine moms are still holding out

But it's over.

Time, doesn't it give some **perspective**

No, you can't come to the wedding

I know he's crazy but he's the one I want

## Florida!!!

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]

You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too

:::tip

There’s a **pun** on the word "heat":

- trying to cool down in hot weather, in places such as Florida.
- increased police attention
- abuse or criticism

:::

They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true

And my friends all smell like **weed** or little babies

:::tip

alluding to the feeling of all her friends being in different life stages

:::

And this city **reeks of** driving myself crazy

:::tip

The room reeks of smoke.

And this city reeks of things (that driving) myself crazy

:::

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]

Little did you know your home's really only a town you're just a guest in

So you work your life away just to pay for a time-share down in Destin

:::tip

We're working away. 努力工作

Destin is a city in Florida that serves as a popular tourist destination.

:::

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]

Florida is one hell of a drug. Florida Can I **use** you **up**?

:::tip

Your boys took one hell of a beating! 你的孩子们被狠狠暴揍了一顿！

:::

[Verse 2: Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]

The **hurricane** with my name when it came

I got drunk and I dared it to **wash** me **away** 冲走

**Barricaded** in the bathroom with a bottle of wine

Well, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time

Yes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine

All my girls got their lace and their crimes

And your cheating husband disappeared, well

No one asks any questions here

So I did my best to **lay to rest**

All of the bodies that have ever been on my body and in my mind, they sink into the **swamp**

Is that a bad thing to say in a song?

[Pre-Chorus: Florence Welch]

Little did you know your home's really only the town you'll get arrested

So you pack your life away just to wait out the firestorm back in Texas

:::tip

You gotta **pack** all your cares **away** 把你的忧虑收拾起来扔掉

:::

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]

I need to forget, so take me to Florida

I've got some **regrets**, I'll bury them in Florida

Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable

At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida

What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida

It's one hell of a drug

Love left me like this and I don't want to exist

So take me to Florida
